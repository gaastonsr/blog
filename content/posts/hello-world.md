Welcome to my tech blog! here I'll be writing about tech topics that I'm
interested in. I'll try to avoid touching personal stuff since I want to have my
career stuff separated from my personal stuff. This blog is intended to be used
by me, to reference stuff that I learnt and forgot and to have an online
presence that future employers can see.

Nevertheless, if you are a geek like me I hope the blog is interesting to you!
not because I talk about technology it should be boring. I'll share some of my
favorite tech stories, I promise they are fun.

Welcome and hope you have fun!
